## 🎯 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
## ⚠️ DO NOT DELETE

*An Ode to COBOL and Grace Hopper*

In circuits of logic and streams of code bright,
Grace Hopper's vision took programming to height.
COBOL, her legacy, business-bound grace,
Making computers speak English with pace.
A pioneer, teacher, and leader so bold,
Her story in ASCII, worth more than gold.
The Queen of Software, with stars on her sleeve,
Showed us all what women in tech can achieve.

## ⚠️ DO NOT DELETE
Alright, folks, listen up! After sifting through a chaotic whirlwind of suggestions, ideas, and outright madness, I've distilled the essence of our collective insanity into one grand project. The theme that echoes the loudest, the vision that shines the brightest, is undeniably... *drumroll*... \"Kyoto: The Ultimate Cat and Cheese Experience\"!

Here's the plan:

**Project Kyoto: The Ultimate Cat and Cheese Experience**

*Description:*
Welcome to Kyoto, an interactive web-based extravaganza where cats and cheese collide in a whimsical dance of delight! This website will feature a gallery of charming cat images, updated every 10 seconds, each with a delightful cheese fact written in the iconic Comic Sans. And because we like to keep things spicy, a fake moustache will serve as our quirky logo, adding a dash of panache to the whole affair.

*Features:* ✨
- **🐱 Cat Image Carousel:** A new adorable cat image every 10 seconds.
- **🧀 Cheese Facts:** Each image will be paired with a fascinating cheese tidbit.
- **🎨 Comic Sans Overlay:** Because nothing says fun like Comic Sans.
- **👨 Fake Moustache Logo:** The pièce de résistance, tying the theme together with flair.

Now, let's get cracking on this feline fromage fiesta and show the world that being unhinged is the new black! Onward to glory, my magnificent team of misfits! 🧀🐱🎩
